## Overview

This was a practice exercise where we were given a plain text file and a CSS file
and then wrote HTML to match the formatting of a provided example.

## Running

This webpage is only made for text display, and since there are no scripts to run it can be
viewed either by opening the raw html file in a browser window, or by running a local server
through VS Code's preview function. To use the preview function, the Live Preview extension
must be installed.
